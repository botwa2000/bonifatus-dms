## Chronological Log (Latest First)

### 2025-10-16: Authentication State Race Condition Fix
**Issue:** After successful OAuth login, users would briefly land on dashboard then immediately get redirected back to login page. OAuth callback succeeded (200), cookies were set correctly, but authentication state wasn't persisting across navigation.
**Root Cause:** Race condition in AuthContext where:
1. Login completes ‚Üí User stored in localStorage ‚Üí Navigate to /dashboard
2. Dashboard AuthContext runs ‚Üí Makes /auth/me API call (doesn't check localStorage first)
3. API call completes but timing causes authentication check to fail
4. Dashboard redirect effect triggers before auth state updates ‚Üí Back to login

**Additional Issue:** AuthContext was re-initializing on every route change due to pathname dependency, causing authentication to be checked repeatedly and potentially clearing auth state during navigation.

**Fix:**
- Updated AuthContext to check localStorage FIRST before making API calls
- If user data exists in localStorage, immediately set authenticated state (no blocking)
- API verification happens in background without blocking UI
- Added `initializedRef` to ensure auth only initializes ONCE per session, not on every route change
- Prevents race condition where navigation happens before API call completes

**Files Modified:** frontend/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx
**Impact:**
- Users remain authenticated after successful login
- Dashboard loads instantly with cached user data
- Background API verification ensures data freshness
- No authentication re-checks during navigation between protected routes
- Smooth user experience without unexpected logouts

### 2025-10-16: Critical OAuth Cookie Domain Fix
**Issue:** OAuth callback succeeded (200 OK) but cookies weren't accessible on subsequent requests, causing authentication to fail after Google redirect.
**Root Cause:** Cookies set with `domain=.bonidoc.com` don't work properly for cross-subdomain authentication between `api.bonidoc.com` (backend) and `bonidoc.com` (frontend).
**Fix:**
- Removed domain attribute from all cookies in auth.py (login, refresh, logout endpoints)
- Set `SameSite=None` with `Secure=True` for cross-origin cookie sharing
- Cookies now work correctly across subdomains without explicit domain specification
**Files Modified:** backend/app/api/auth.py
**Impact:** Google OAuth login flow now works end-to-end - users successfully authenticate and land on dashboard.

### 2025-10-16: Frontend Route Configuration System
**Issue:** Landing page made unnecessary `/auth/me` API calls on every load, causing duplicate requests and console error noise.
**Root Cause:** AuthContext attempted to verify authentication on all routes, including public pages where users aren't logged in.
**Solution:** Created centralized route configuration system with pattern-based detection.
**Implementation:**
- Created `frontend/src/lib/route-config.ts` with public/protected route definitions
- Added `isProtectedRoute()` function with pattern matching for flexibility
- Updated AuthContext to skip auth checks on public routes
- Suppressed expected 401 error logging in api-client.ts for auth endpoints
**Files Created:** frontend/src/lib/route-config.ts
**Files Modified:** frontend/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx, frontend/src/services/api-client.ts
**Impact:**
- Landing page loads without auth API calls
- Cleaner console (no noise from expected 401s)
- No hardcoded routes in components
- Easy to add new public routes

### 2025-10-13: Missing System Library - libmagic1
Added libmagic1 to Dockerfile system dependencies for python-magic file validation.
**Fix:** Updated apt-get install to include libmagic1 package.

### 2025-10-13: Missing Import - Optional Type
Added Optional to typing imports in config.py for SecuritySettings.
**Fix:** Changed `from typing import List` to `from typing import List, Optional`.

### 2025-10-13: Encryption Key Format Invalid
Generated valid 32-byte Fernet encryption key for field-level encryption.
**Fix:** Updated ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable with properly formatted key.

### 2025-10-13: Security Services Implemented
Created encryption_service.py (117 lines) and session_service.py (295 lines) for secure token management.
**Features:** AES-256 encryption, 7-day refresh tokens, session tracking, automatic cleanup.

### 2025-10-13: Auth Service Updated
Integrated session management with reduced token expiry (30min ‚Üí 15min).
**Changes:** Encrypt Google tokens, refresh token endpoint, session-based logout, login attempt tracking.

### 2025-10-13: Config Extended for Security
Added encryption_key and turnstile keys to SecuritySettings class.
**Environment Variables:** ENCRYPTION_KEY, TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY, TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY added.

### 2025-10-13: Security Middleware Services Created
Implemented trust_scoring_service.py (behavioral analysis), captcha_service.py (Cloudflare Turnstile), file_validation_service.py (multi-layer validation).
**Features:** User trust scoring, CAPTCHA integration, malware detection, storage quotas.

### 2025-10-13: Security Router Added
Created security.py API router with CAPTCHA verification and trust score endpoints.
**Endpoints:** /verify-captcha, /trust-score, /captcha-site-key (public).

### 2025-10-13: ML Category Service Import Fixed
Updated CategoryTermWeight references to CategoryKeyword after model rename.
**Fix:** Changed 5 references in ml_category_service.py (imports, queries, instantiation).

### 2025-10-13: Migration Chain Fork Resolved
Fixed multiple head revisions pointing to same parent migration.
**Fix:** Changed l3m4n5o6p7q8 down_revision from k1l2m3n4o5p6 to d3e4f5g6h7i8.

### 2025-10-12: JSONB Import Missing
Added missing JSONB import to database models for JSON field types.
**Fix:** Added `from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB` to models.

## Status Summary

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Security Foundation**
- Encryption service (AES-256 Fernet)
- Session management (7-day refresh tokens)
- Trust scoring (behavioral analysis)
- CAPTCHA service (Cloudflare Turnstile)
- File validation (multi-layer security)
- Security router endpoints

**‚è≥ Phase 1 Remaining:**
- Rate limiting service (3-tier: auth/write/read)
- Security headers middleware
- httpOnly cookie implementation
- Refresh token API endpoint

**üìã Next Phase: Document Processing & Classification**
- OCR text extraction (Tesseract + PyMuPDF)
- Keyword overlap scoring
- Classification tables & system keywords
- Category learning from user corrections

### 2025-10-14: Phase 1 Security Foundation Completed
**Fix:** Implemented rate limiting (3-tier), security headers middleware, httpOnly cookies, refresh token endpoint, migrated frontend from localStorage to secure cookie-based authentication.

### 2025-10-14: Main.py Cleanup & Middleware Order
Removed duplicate middleware registrations, fixed import order, moved startup tasks to lifespan, replaced hardcoded URLs with env variables.

### 2025-10-15: Cross-Domain httpOnly Cookie Authentication Fixed
Fix: Added domain=.bonidoc.com to cookies in callback/refresh/logout for cross-subdomain sharing, cleared cookies properly on logout with max_age=0.
Fix: Replaced localStorage token retrieval with httpOnly cookie authentication (credentials: 'include') in batch upload and config loading endpoints.
Fixed sameSite="none" for production cross-origin cookies (bonidoc.com ‚Üî api.bonidoc.com), deduplicated concurrent auth initialization preventing 10+ parallel /auth/me requests.
Created AuthProvider context to initialize authentication once at app level, preventing 10+ concurrent /auth/me requests on homepage load. Moved auth logic from useAuth hook to centralized provider.
Silenced Auth Errors on Public Pages: Removed debug logging from auth service and made AuthProvider handle 401 errors silently on public pages where users aren't logged in (expected behavior).
