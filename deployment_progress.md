## Status Summary

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Security Foundation**
- Encryption service (AES-256 Fernet)
- Session management (7-day refresh tokens)
- Trust scoring (behavioral analysis)
- CAPTCHA service (Cloudflare Turnstile)
- File validation (multi-layer security)
- Security router endpoints

**‚è≥ Phase 1 Remaining:**
- Rate limiting service (3-tier: auth/write/read)
- Security headers middleware
- httpOnly cookie implementation
- Refresh token API endpoint

**üìã Next Phase: Document Processing & Classification**
- OCR text extraction (Tesseract + PyMuPDF)
- Keyword overlap scoring
- Classification tables & system keywords
- Category learning from user corrections

### 2025-10-14: Phase 1 Security Foundation Completed
**Fix:** Implemented rate limiting (3-tier), security headers middleware, httpOnly cookies, refresh token endpoint, migrated frontend from localStorage to secure cookie-based authentication.

### 2025-10-14: Main.py Cleanup & Middleware Order
Removed duplicate middleware registrations, fixed import order, moved startup tasks to lifespan, replaced hardcoded URLs with env variables.

### 2025-10-15: Cross-Domain httpOnly Cookie Authentication Fixed
Fix: Added domain=.bonidoc.com to cookies in callback/refresh/logout for cross-subdomain sharing, cleared cookies properly on logout with max_age=0.
Fix: Replaced localStorage token retrieval with httpOnly cookie authentication (credentials: 'include') in batch upload and config loading endpoints.
Fixed sameSite="none" for production cross-origin cookies (bonidoc.com ‚Üî api.bonidoc.com), deduplicated concurrent auth initialization preventing 10+ parallel /auth/me requests.
Created AuthProvider context to initialize authentication once at app level, preventing 10+ concurrent /auth/me requests on homepage load. Moved auth logic from useAuth hook to centralized provider.
Silenced Auth Errors on Public Pages: Removed debug logging from auth service and made AuthProvider handle 401 errors silently on public pages where users aren't logged in (expected behavior).
