### 2.3 System Architecture Principles

**Security Layers**
1. Transport Security: HTTPS with HSTS headers
2. Authentication: Google OAuth + JWT (15-minute access, 7-day refresh)
3. Session Management: Track and revoke active sessions
4. Field-Level Encryption: OAuth tokens only (pragmatic approach)
5. Rate Limiting: Three-tier limits (auth/write/read operations)
6. Input Validation: Pydantic models for all API inputs
7. Audit Logging: All security events logged with context

**Encryption Strategy**
- Documents: NOT encrypted (stored in user's Google Drive, already protected)
- OAuth Tokens: Encrypted with Fernet AES-256
- Keywords: NOT encrypted (semantic descriptors, not sensitive data)
- Metadata: NOT encrypted (filenames, categories, timestamps - needed for queries)
- Audit Logs: Log standardized filenames only, not original filenames

**Data Flow**
```
User Upload → File Validation → Temporary In-Memory Storage → Text Extraction (OCR if needed)
→ Language Detection → Keyword Extraction (semantic only, no entities) → Date Extraction
→ Category Classification (suggest ONE primary) → User Review & Correction (change primary, add more)
→ Permanent Storage (Google Drive in category folder) → Database Metadata (encrypted where needed)
→ ML Learning Update (adjust keyword weights per language) → Temp File Cleanup
```

**Learning Cycle**
```
System Suggests Primary Category → User Confirms/Changes Primary + Adds Secondary Categories
→ Log Decision → Adjust Keyword Weights (+10% correct, -5% incorrect)
→ Calculate Daily Accuracy Metrics → Improved Future Suggestions
```

**Document Naming Convention**
```
Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_CategoryCode_OriginalName.ext
Example: 20251017_143022_TAX_invoice_2024.pdf

Immutable Filename Strategy:
- Filename preserves original primary category (audit trail)
- On reclassification: Document moves to new folder, filename stays same
- Current primary category always available in UI and database
- Prevents broken links, simpler implementation, clear history
```

## 4. Development Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Security Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Lock down the platform before adding features

**Database Updates**
- Rename category_term_weights → category_keywords
- Create user_sessions table for session tracking
- Add encryption columns for sensitive data

**Security Services**
- Encryption service (Fernet AES-256)
- Session management service (7-day refresh tokens)
- Rate limiting service (3-tier: auth/write/read)
- File validation service (multi-layer security)
- Security monitoring service (behavioral analysis)

**Authentication Updates**

- Reduce access token expiry to 15 minutes
- Implement refresh token with 7-day expiry
- Track active sessions in database

**Security Middleware**
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input sanitization with Pydantic
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Cross-Domain Authentication Architecture**
- Backend (api.bonidoc.com) sets httpOnly cookies with SameSite=None
- Frontend (bonidoc.com) automatically sends cookies with API requests
- Authentication enforced at API level, not middleware
- Protected pages check auth via /auth/me API endpoint
- Full page reload after OAuth login for proper context initialization
- No client-side token manipulation (security by design)

**OAuth Login Flow** (October 17, 2025)
- Issue: After Google OAuth login, users were redirected back to blank login page
- Root cause: Client-side navigation (router.push) didn't re-initialize AuthContext
- Solution: Changed to window.location.href for full page reload after login
- Result: OAuth flow now works correctly end-to-end
- Security: All authentication tokens remain in httpOnly cookies only

**Milestone Criteria:**
- All tokens stored in httpOnly cookies ✅
- Session revocation working ✅
- Rate limiting active on all endpoints ✅
- Security headers present on all responses ✅
- Audit logs capturing all security events ✅
- OAuth login flow working correctly ✅

- Update document analysis to detect scanned vs native text PDFs
- Extract text from images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)
- Process documents in-memory (files <10MB), encrypted temp dir for larger files
- Immediate cleanup of temporary files after processing

**2B: Keyword Extraction (Language-Aware)**
- Extract semantic keywords only (nouns, verbs), not entities (names, numbers)
- Filter stop words per language (ru/en/de, scalable to more)
- Frequency-based keyword scoring
- Limit keyword length (max 50 chars to prevent full sentences)
- Store keywords unencrypted (semantic descriptors, not sensitive data)

**2C: Classification Engine**
- Implement keyword overlap scoring algorithm per language
- Apply confidence thresholds (60% minimum, 20% gap requirement)
- Suggest ONE primary category (highest confidence)
- Populate system keywords database (150+ keywords in en/de/ru)
- Handle ambiguous cases (suggest "Other" category)
- Language-scalable architecture (easy to add new languages)

**2D: Date Extraction**
- Extract ONE primary document date per document (invoice date, tax year, signature date, etc.)
- Store in documents.document_date with confidence score
- Multi-language date pattern recognition (DD.MM.YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
- Store as ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) internally, display per user locale
- Optional: Extract secondary dates (expiry, due date) in document_dates table

**2E: Category Learning & ML Feedback Loop**
- Record all classification decisions in document_classification_log
- Track user's final choice (confirmed, changed primary, added secondary)
- Reinforce correct suggestions (+10% keyword weight for that language)
- Penalize incorrect suggestions (-5% keyword weight for that language)
- Calculate daily accuracy metrics per category per language
- Display learning progress and "why this category?" explanations to users

**Multi-Category Assignment Logic**
- System suggests ONE primary category
- User can: approve, change primary, add unlimited secondary categories
- document_categories table tracks is_primary flag
- ML learns from both primary and secondary assignments
- All user decisions feed back into keyword weight adjustments

**Milestone Criteria:**
- OCR successfully extracts text from scanned documents
- Classification suggests correct primary category ≥70% of the time
- System learns from user corrections (weights adjust per language)
- Date extraction works with ≥80% accuracy
- Daily metrics show accuracy improvement trends
- Users can view "why this category?" explanation with keyword matches
- Architecture supports easy addition of new languages (not hardcoded to ru/en/de)

### Phase 3: Google Drive Integration

**Objective:** Store documents securely in user's personal Google Drive with proper folder organization

**Drive Schema (Already in Place)**
- google_drive_folders: Category folder mappings (user_id, category_id, folder_id)
- google_drive_sync_status: Quota tracking and sync state
- documents.drive_file_id: Google's unique file ID
- documents.drive_folder_id: Category folder reference
- users.google_drive_connected: Connection status flag

**Drive Folder Structure**
```
/BoniDoc/
├── Tax Documents/
├── Insurance/
├── Contracts/
├── Legal/
├── Medical/
├── Receipts/
├── Certificates/
├── Real Estate/
└── Other/
```

**Drive Service Implementation**
- Initialize Drive connection with OAuth scope (drive.file for security)
- Create folder structure on first upload (lazy initialization)
- Upload files with standardized names to appropriate category folders
- Generate temporary download links (1-hour expiry for security)
- Track storage quotas and warn users at 80% capacity
- Handle Drive API errors gracefully (rate limits, quota exceeded, network failures)
- Move files between folders on category reclassification (filename stays same)

**Upload Flow with Drive Integration**
1. User uploads document → Temporary backend storage
2. OCR/text extraction → Classification → User review
3. User confirms categories → Upload to Drive in primary category folder
4. Store drive_file_id and metadata in database
5. Delete temporary file from backend
6. Return success with Drive link to user

**Reclassification Flow**
- User changes primary category → Move file to new folder in Drive
- Filename remains unchanged (immutable naming strategy)
- Update documents.primary_category_id and documents.drive_folder_id
- Log reclassification in audit_logs
- No broken links (drive_file_id stays same even after move)

**Frontend Updates**
- Drive connection UI in settings page
- Storage quota display with progress bar
- Document detail page with "View in Drive" button
- Download functionality via temporary links
- Warning messages when quota approaching limit

**Security Considerations**
- OAuth scope limited to drive.file (only access BoniDoc-created files)
- All Drive API calls over HTTPS
- Temporary download links expire after 1 hour
- No document content logged or stored in backend
- User can revoke Drive access anytime

**Milestone Criteria:**
- Users can connect their Google Drive via OAuth

---

## 6. Design Decisions & Rationale

### 6.1 Classification & Categorization

**Multi-Category Assignment**
- Decision: Unlimited categories per document, one marked as primary
- Rationale: Real-world documents often belong to multiple categories (e.g., "Tax" + "Real Estate")
- Implementation: document_categories table with is_primary boolean flag
- User Flow: System suggests ONE primary → user can approve/change/add more
- ML Impact: All assignments (primary + secondary) feed into learning algorithm

**Primary Category Selection**
- Decision: System suggests ONE primary based on highest confidence score
- Rationale: Reduces cognitive load, provides clear recommendation, user maintains control
- Fallback: If confidence <60% or top two within 20%, suggest "Other" category
- User Override: User can always change suggested primary to any category

**Category Learning Strategy**
- Decision: Keyword weight adjustment per language (+10% correct, -5% incorrect)
- Rationale: Asymmetric learning (faster reinforcement, slower penalty) prevents over-correction
- Granularity: Weights tracked per category per keyword per language
- Scalability: Architecture supports unlimited languages without code changes

### 6.2 Keyword Extraction Philosophy

**Semantic Keywords Only**
- Decision: Extract nouns/verbs, NOT entities (names, numbers, IDs)
- Rationale: "invoice" helps classification, "123-45-6789" does not
- Security Benefit: No PII accidentally stored as keywords
- Example: Extract "passport application" not "John Smith passport A1234567"

**No Keyword Encryption**
- Decision: Store keywords in plaintext (unencrypted)
- Rationale: Keywords are content descriptors, not sensitive data
- Performance: Enables fast searches, efficient indexing, no decryption overhead
- User Benefit: Fast classification, instant search results

**Language-Specific Processing**
- Decision: Stop words, patterns, and weights tracked per language
- Rationale: Word importance varies by language ("the" irrelevant in English, meaningful in other contexts)
- Scalability: New languages added via database configuration, not code changes
- Storage: language column in keywords, category_keywords, and stop_words tables

### 6.3 OCR & Text Extraction Strategy

**Two-Stage Intelligent Extraction**
- Decision: PyMuPDF for native PDFs, Tesseract OCR only when needed
- Rationale: Most PDFs have good embedded text; OCR is slow and resource-intensive
- Stage 1: Fast extraction with PyMuPDF (milliseconds)
- Stage 2: Quality assessment with spell-checking
- Stage 3: Re-OCR only if quality < 60% threshold
- Result: 95% of documents use fast path, 5% get high-quality re-OCR

**Quality Assessment with Spell-Checking**
- Decision: Use pyspellchecker library to detect OCR corruption
- Rationale: ML-based, language-aware, catches ALL OCR errors (not hardcoded patterns)
- Method: Sample 100 words, check spelling error rate
- Thresholds:
  - <15% errors = excellent (0.95-1.0 score) → use embedded text
  - 15-30% errors = good (0.7-0.95 score) → use embedded text
  - 30-50% errors = poor (0.5-0.7 score) → use embedded text
  - >50% errors = garbage (<0.5 score) → re-OCR with Tesseract
- Languages: EN, DE, RU, ES, FR, PT, IT (cached for performance)

**PyMuPDF for Superior Text Extraction**
- Decision: Replace PyPDF2 with PyMuPDF (fitz)
- Rationale: 10x better text extraction quality, handles complex PDFs
- Benefits:
  - Preserves formatting, tables, multi-column layouts
  - Fast (written in C)
  - No external dependencies (no poppler needed)
  - Also used for PDF-to-image rendering (300 DPI)
- Free: AGPL license, completely open source

**Tesseract OCR Configuration**
- Engine: OEM 3 (LSTM neural network mode)
- Page Segmentation: PSM 3 (automatic page segmentation)
- Preprocessing:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Fast non-local means denoising
  - Adaptive Gaussian thresholding (better than Otsu for varying lighting)
  - Optional morphological operations for very poor scans
- Resolution: 300 DPI rendering for optimal accuracy
- Languages: Multi-language support (deu+eng for German documents)

**Example: Bank Statement Test Case**
- **Before (PyPDF2)**: "peptember", "bro", "fmportant", "holderW" (garbage)
- **After (PyMuPDF + quality check)**: Detected poor quality (58.8% score)
- **Re-OCR (Tesseract)**: "September", "EUR", "Important", "holder" (94.5% confidence)
- **Result**: 9/9 keywords found, 100% accuracy

**Performance Characteristics**
- Native PDF extraction: <100ms per page
- Quality assessment: <50ms (cached spell checker)
- OCR processing (when needed): 3-8 seconds per page at 300 DPI
- Overall: 95% of documents processed in <1 second

**Cost & Dependencies**
- Zero API costs (all processing local)
- Dependencies: PyMuPDF (free), Tesseract (free), pyspellchecker (free)
- No cloud services required
- Scales horizontally without additional costs

### 6.4 Document Naming & File Management

**Immutable Filename Strategy**
- Decision: Filenames never change after creation
- Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_CategoryCode_OriginalName.ext
- Rationale: Preserves audit trail, prevents broken links, simpler implementation
- On Reclassification: File moves to new folder, filename stays same
- Trade-off Accepted: Filename shows original category, not current (current always in UI)

**Upload Timestamp vs Document Date**
- Decision: Both stored separately, different purposes
- Upload Timestamp: In filename, immutable, system-generated
- Document Date: Extracted from content, editable, user-meaningful
- Display: Show both in UI ("Uploaded Oct 17, 2025 • Document Date: Mar 15, 2024")
- Search: Users search by document date, not upload timestamp

**Google Drive Folder Structure**
- Decision: Flat folder structure by category (/BoniDoc/CategoryName/)
- Rationale: Simple, mirrors category system, easy to navigate
- On Reclassification: Move file between folders using Drive API
- User Benefit: Clear organization, manual Drive access makes sense

### 6.4 Security & Encryption Strategy

**Pragmatic Encryption Approach**
- Decision: Encrypt only OAuth tokens, not keywords/metadata
- Rationale: Balance security, performance, maintenance cost, user experience
- Documents: NOT encrypted (stored in user's Google Drive, already protected)
- Keywords: NOT encrypted (semantic descriptors, not sensitive)
- Tokens: Encrypted with Fernet AES-256 (highest risk attack vector)

**No PII Detection/Extraction**
- Decision: Skip automatic PII detection
- Rationale: High complexity, constant maintenance, low value-add, false positives
- Alternative: Extract semantic keywords only (ignore entities by design)
- Benefit: Simpler codebase, no language-specific regex patterns needed

**Audit Logging Approach**
- Decision: Log standardized filenames, not original filenames
- Rationale: Balance traceability with privacy
- Example Logged: "20251017_143022_TAX_invoice.pdf" ✓
- Example NOT Logged: "john_smith_secret_tax_return.pdf" ✗
- User Benefit: Can identify their documents in audit logs without exposing sensitive names

### 6.5 Date Extraction Design

**Primary Document Date**
- Decision: Extract ONE main date per document
- Storage: documents.document_date (DATE) + document_date_confidence (FLOAT)
- Rationale: Most documents have one meaningful date (invoice date, contract date, tax year)
- Display: Show with context ("Invoice Date: Mar 15, 2024")

**Secondary Dates (Optional)**
- Decision: Extract additional dates only if useful for search/organization
- Storage: document_dates table (future enhancement)
- Examples: Expiry dates, due dates, tax years, contract periods
- Implementation: Phase 2D (optional), can defer to later phase

**Date Format Strategy**
- Storage: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) in database (universal, sortable)
- Display: User's locale preference (MM/DD/YYYY for US, DD.MM.YYYY for EU/RU)
- Extraction: Multi-language pattern matching (handle all common formats)

### 6.6 Language Scalability

**Database-Driven Language Support**
- Decision: All language-specific data in database tables, not code
- Tables: stop_words, category_keywords, localization_strings all have language column
- Rationale: Adding new language = data migration, not code deployment
- Process: Admin adds new language via database, no code changes needed

**Initial Language Set**
- Start: Russian, English, German (ru, en, de)
- Why: User base primary languages, sufficient to prove scalability
- Future: Any language supported by adding data (stop words, translations, system keywords)

**Language Detection**
- Decision: Detect document language during text extraction
- Storage: document_languages table (supports multi-language documents)
- Impact: Classification uses language-specific keyword weights
- Fallback: If detection fails, use user's preferred language from settings

### 6.7 Machine Learning Approach

**Keyword Overlap Scoring**
- Algorithm: Count matching keywords between document and category
- Formula: score = (matching_keywords * avg_weight) / total_document_keywords
- Thresholds: 60% minimum confidence, 20% gap between top two
- Rationale: Simple, explainable, language-agnostic, fast

**Weight Adjustment Rules**
- Correct Prediction: +10% to all matching keywords
- Incorrect Prediction: -5% to all matching keywords that led to wrong choice
- Rationale: Asymmetric learning prevents over-correction from single mistakes
- Bounds: Weights bounded [0.1, 10.0] to prevent extreme values

**Transparency & Explainability**
- Decision: Show users WHY a category was suggested
- Display: "Matched keywords: invoice, payment, tax (85% confidence)"
- Benefit: Users trust system, understand decisions, provide better corrections
- ML Impact: Explicit feedback improves learning quality

### 6.8 User Experience Principles

**Batch Upload Flow**
1. User uploads multiple files → System analyzes in parallel
2. Show progress per file with extracted info preview
3. User reviews all suggestions at once (approve/modify/add categories)
4. Confirm → Upload to Drive + Store metadata + Learn from decisions
5. Show success with links to Drive files

**Confidence Visualization**
- High Confidence (≥80%): Green indicator, "Recommended"
- Medium Confidence (60-80%): Yellow indicator, "Suggested"
- Low Confidence (<60%): Gray indicator, "Uncertain - Please Review"
- Rationale: Clear visual feedback builds trust, prompts user attention where needed

**Mobile-First Design**
- All interactions work with touch (no hover-only features)
- Large touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Responsive tables/lists collapse to cards on mobile

## 7. Quality Control & Deployment Process

### 7.1 Pre-Commit Checklist

**Code Quality**
- Run linter (flake8 for Python, eslint for TypeScript)
- Verify no hardcoded values (grep for common patterns)
- Confirm all files <300 lines
- Check for duplicate functions
- Verify file header comment present

**Functionality**
- Test locally: All affected features work correctly
- Test edge cases: Invalid inputs, empty states, large datasets
- Test multi-language: Verify translations load correctly
- Test dark mode: UI renders correctly in both themes
- Test mobile: Responsive design on small screens

**Security**
- No sensitive data in code (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- No user input used directly in SQL queries
- All file uploads validated (magic bytes, size, type)
- Rate limiting present on new endpoints
- Audit logging added for sensitive operations

### 7.2 Deployment Process

**🔄 HETZNER VPS DEPLOYMENT (October 23, 2025)**

For complete migration guide, see: **`HETZNER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`**

**Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions → Hetzner)**
```
1. Push code to main branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers CI/CD pipeline
3. Backend: Run tests → Build Docker image
4. Frontend: Run tests → Build Next.js
5. SSH to Hetzner VPS
6. Execute deployment script: ~/deploy.sh
7. Script: Pull code → Rebuild containers → Restart services
8. Completes in 5-8 minutes
```

**Manual Deployment (on Hetzner server)**
```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
~/deploy.sh
```

The deploy script:
- Pulls latest code from GitHub
- Rebuilds Docker images
- Stops containers
- Starts containers with new code
- Verifies health checks

**Post-Deployment Verification**
```
1. Backend health check: curl https://api.bonidoc.com/health
2. Frontend health check: curl https://bonidoc.com
3. Database check: Verify tables exist and migrations applied
4. Smoke test: Login → Create category → Upload document → Logout
5. Check logs: docker-compose logs -f
6. Monitor resources: htop, docker stats
```

### 7.3 Performance Benchmarks

**Target Metrics**
- API response time (p95): <200ms
- Database query time (p95): <100ms
- Document upload (single file): <5s
- Batch analysis (10 files): <30s
- OCR processing (per page): <10s
- Page load time: <2s

## 8. Project Instructions Summary

### Principles to Follow

**Code Quality**
- Files modular (<300 lines), production-ready only
- No hardcoded values, all from database/config
- Root cause fixes, no workarounds
- Check for duplicates before creating new code
- Professional comments explaining "why" not "what"

**Security**
- Security-first: encryption, httpOnly cookies, rate limiting
- Never trust client input
- Log all security events with context
- Fail-safe defaults

**Development Process**
- One step at a time, wait for confirmation
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Update deployment_progress.md after each fix
- Update DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md after completing phases
